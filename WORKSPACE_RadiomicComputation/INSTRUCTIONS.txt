******************  INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING THE EXAMPLE WORKSPACE ******************
*************************************************************************************

1. Clone the GitHub repository on your computer by running "git clone https://github.com/mvallieres/radiomics-develop" in the terminal.

2. Copy the folder "WORKSPACE_RadiomicComputation" (radiomics-develop/WORKSPACE_RadiomicComputation) to your favorite working directory on your computer (don't run things from your cloned GitHub directory). 

3. Download the example DICOM data at: https://www.dropbox.com/s/whr9hquppft5f9v/DICOM.zip?dl=0

4. Extract the DICOM folder (DICOM.zip downloaded in step 3), and move it inside the WORKSPACE_RadiomicComputation folder that you copied in step 2.

5. Open MATLAB and set up the MATLAB path on your computer to include all sub-folders contained in /radiomics-develop/Code on your computer (this folder should stay where you cloned the GitHub directory on your computer).

6. Navigate in MATLAB inside the WORKSPACE_RadiomicComputation folder that you copied in step 2, and run script_ReadData.m (make sure python is installed on your computer for this step to succeed). At the end of this step, new .mat files for all scans of all patients will be saved in a new folder DATA inside the WORKSPACE_RadiomicComputation folder that you copied in step 2.

7. Optionally, construct a new roiNames.mat file using new ROIs. This file can be semi-automatically constructed by setting the manualROIchoice variable to true in script_ComputeRadiomics.m. Please also see WORKSPACE.txt in the WORKSPACE_RadiomicComputation folder for more details.

8. Run script_ComputeRadiomics.m in the WORKSPACE_RadiomicComputation folder. At the end of this step, a new folder FEATURES will be created with all radiomic features for all scans of all patients. Please see RADIOMIC_OUTPUT.txt in the WORKSPACE_RadiomicComputation folder for more details.

9. Once step 6 is performed, steps 7 and 8 can be repeated for different ROIs as defined by the roiNames.mat file. Make sure to also change the "roiType" variable name in the parameter options of script_ComputeRadiomics.m.



--> IMPORTANT: Before performing steps 6 to 9, please make sure to familiarize yourself with: 1) README.md in /radiomics-develop; 2) https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07003; 3) WORKSPACE_FORMAT.txt in /radiomics-develop/WORKSPACE_RadiomicComputation; 4) All comments in script_ReadData.m and script_ComputeRadiomics.m; 5) roiNames.xlsx in /radiomics-develop/WORKSPACE_RadiomicComputation; 4) INSTRUCTIONS.txt in /radiomics-develop/WORKSPACE_RadiomicComputation; and 6) RADIOMIC_OUTPUT.txt in /radiomics-develop/WORKSPACE_RadiomicComputation. Do not hesitate to contact Martin ValliÃ¨res if you have any question.

--> NEW RADIOMICS STUDIES: IF ALL STEPS DESCRIBED ABOVE RUNS FINE ON YOUR COMPUTER USING THE EXAMPLE DATA AND WORKSPACE, YOU CAN NOW ADAPT THIS WORKSPACE TO COMPUTE RADIOMIC FEATURES ON YOUR OWN DATASETS!!
